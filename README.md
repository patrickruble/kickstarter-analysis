# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover and identify successful trends
##Overview of Project
Using the Kickstarter dataset, we can analyze the outcomes of plays based on their launch dates and funding goals. With this information weâ€™re able to find the most successful month for these plays, as well as an approachable funding goal.
##An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
The outcome based on Launch Date helped determine the most successful months for plays to be released. Using this data, we find May is the month with the most successful plays, while December is by far the worst. The second outcome, based on the initial funding goal, highlighted that about 50% of plays reach their goals, or fail to reach their goals. 
### Conclusions based on Launch Date
May is the most successful month to put on a show. The winter months like November and December were historically pretty unsuccessful.
### Conclusions of Outcomes based on Goals
The outcomes based on goals were met about 50% of the time. 
### Limitations based on Data Set
This dataset does not include theatre productions put on by other countries, only the US.
### Additional Research
To further delve into successful productions, we could use the genre of play ie musical, drama, etc. to construct a pie chart to show the most popular genre of play.
